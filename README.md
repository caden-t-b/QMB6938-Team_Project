# QMB6938-Team_Project
Assignment 13
This assignment will be completed by submitting a PowerPoint Presentation and a Jupyter Notebook file (not the PDF or HTML, but rather the Jupyter Notebook .ipynb file) on Canvas. This team assignment will need to be uploaded to Canvas by the assignment due date.

Purpose: There are several purposes for this assignment. First, you will begin to work on an analytics assignment as a team. Second, you will experience an end-to-end analytics process and complete each step. Third, you will try to achieve an acceptable modeling outcome using a method that is transparent and explainable. And fourth, you will create a presentation for leadership explaining your analysis and outcome.

Importance:  This project is important because it provides practice in the end-to-end process. It also allows team members to work out responsibilities and practice developing and executing project plans before meeting with actual practicum project sponsors.

If you have any questions about the assignment, please email me at jim.hoover@warrington.ufl.edu. I’m also available during office hours to help you with questions about your modeling approach or your final briefing.

Assignment: You will start the project with a file from Canvas – flinfo2022.csv Download flinfo2022.csv. This file contains information about Florida counties from the John Hopkins COVID19 GitHub site. Your assignment will contain multiple components:

25 points - A PowerPoint presentation that contains:

A title slide that includes all of your team members names, pictures and team name
At least one slide for each CRISP-DM analytics process step that explains each of the activities that you did in the analytics process:
Business Understanding – including the business problem statement
Data Understanding – including a data dictionary
Data Preparation – including new variables added
Modeling – including model assessment
Evaluation – including evaluation of whether the model matches the business need
Deployment – including how the model could be used and whether it should be deployed
25 points - A Jupyter Notebook .ipynb file (not the HTML or PDF version, but the Jupyter Notebook file itself), that permits the person opening the file to review and run your code and see your output. The Jupyter Notebook .ipynb file should contain:

A header section that contains the names of your team
Text that describes what each of your Python code blocks accomplishes
Python code blocks that can be run successfully:
The Python code blocks and the Jupyter Notebook should include any libraries necessary for the code to run successfully
The Python code blocks should illustrate the output that they produce (if necessary to explain the step)
Python code blocks that:
Permit data to be loaded for model building
If scraped from the web, permit the code to be scraped successfully
Identify data sources and allow them to be loaded from the Jupyter Notebook file
If manually downloaded from the web (e.g., into an Excel file), provide the file(s) with the rest of your submission.
Illustrate steps involved in data cleansing
Merges at least one (or more) additional datasets to the original dataset
Contains model assessment outputs that illustrate the effectiveness of your model to predict
Since this is a numeric prediction model, I suggest that you use R-squared as your assessment metric.
The Statsmodels package for Python produces many numeric prediction model assessment metrics.
If you use additional data files that are combined rather than extracted from the web and combined, you must provide those additional files with your submission!
Directions for completing the assignment: This assignment will be completed on UF e-Learning (Canvas) by submitting a PowerPoint and a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) file. Please contact me prior to the submission date if you have a conflict that prevents uploading the assignment by this time. This assignment will receive a maximum of 50 points.

For the team with the most accurate model (as assessed by the professor) that predicts the Florida county fatality rate, that team’s members will receive a bonus of 4 points added to their overall grade points for the class. I will evaluate using both R-squared and Adjusted R-squared measures.
